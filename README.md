Predicts **traffic congestion patterns** based on weather, time of day, and road conditions using **LSTM Neural Networks**. Helps optimize traffic signals and reduce congestion.

**Project Overview**  
Urban areas face daily traffic congestion. This project applies **deep learning** to analyze patterns and predict traffic jams, helping optimize city planning.

**Technologies Used**  
Deep Learning Models: 
  - LSTM Neural Network  
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization:Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Features**
Real-time traffic pattern forecasting 
Weather & time-based congestion analysis
Predictive modeling for smarter urban planning

**Results**  
LSTM model successfully predicts traffic trends, aiding transport systems.  
Weather & peak hours significantly affect congestion patterns.
